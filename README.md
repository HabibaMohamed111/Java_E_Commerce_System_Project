This Java project, named ECommerceSystem, is a simple implementation of an e-commerce system. The main class, ECommerceSystem, initializes a basic command-line interface for interacting with the system. It prompts the user to input their customer ID, name, and address, then allows them to add products to their cart and place an order.

The project includes classes for customers (Customer), electronic products (ElectronicProduct), clothing products (ClothingProduct), and book products (BookProduct). It also features a cart (Cart) for managing selected products and an order (Order) for finalizing purchases.

The commented-out section of the main method suggests an initial implementation for interacting with the system via the command line. However, it appears that the project also includes a GUI component, as evidenced by the instantiation of EcommerceSystemGUI. This GUI component is likely intended to provide a more user-friendly interface for interacting with the e-commerce system.

Overall, the project aims to provide a foundation for building a basic e-commerce platform, combining both command-line and graphical user interface functionalities.
